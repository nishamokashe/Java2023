/*Modularity: Introduced a separate method displayResult to handle the
 display of the result. This separates concerns and improves code organization.

Readability: Added comments to explain the purpose of each section of
 code, making it easier to understand.

Clarity: Renamed variables in the displayResult method to
 num1, num2, and result for improved clarity.
 
This refactoring enhances the readability and maintainability of
 the code by breaking it down into smaller, more focused methods and providing 
 descriptive comments.*/

 /*
********Code Explaination********

The code defines a Java class called CodeRefactor32 with two static methods: add and displayResult.

The add method takes two integers num1 and num2 as input and returns their sum.

The main method is the entry point of the program. It first declares and initializes two integer variables number1 and number2 to the values 5 and 10, respectively. It then calls the add method with number1 and number2 as arguments and assigns the result to the sum variable. Finally, it calls the displayResult method with number1, number2, and sum as arguments to display the result.

The displayResult method takes three integers num1, num2, and result as input and prints a message to the console indicating that the sum of num1 and num2 is result.
