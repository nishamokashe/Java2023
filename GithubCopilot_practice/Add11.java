//Code Review Exercise
/*Enhancement: Error Handling: Add error handling to handle cases where
 input values are invalid or unexpected.

Refactoring: Improved Variable Names: 
Use more descriptive variable names to improve readability.

Alternative Implementation: Using Scanner for User Input: 
Allow users to input the numbers dynamically using the Scanner class.

/*
 * 

This is a Java program that adds two numbers together. Here's a breakdown of the code:

Class Add11

This class has two methods: add and main.

Method add

This method takes two int parameters, a and b.
It returns the sum of a and b.

Method main

This is the entry point of the program.
It creates a Scanner object to read input from the user.
It uses a try-catch-finally block to handle errors.

Inside the try block:

It prompts the user to enter two numbers using System.out.print.
It reads the user's input using scanner.nextInt() and stores the values in num1 and num2.
It calls the add method to calculate the sum of num1 and num2.
It prints the result to the console using System.out.println.

Inside the catch block:

It catches any exceptions that occur during the execution of the try block.
It prints an error message to the console if the user enters invalid input (e.g., non-integer values).

Inside the finally block:

It closes the Scanner object to free up system resources.
